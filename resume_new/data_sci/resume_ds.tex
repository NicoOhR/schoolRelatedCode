% Rover Resume - Base Template
% Link: https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume
%
% Shows code for various formatting options for different resume sections.
% Education and Projects have single-line headers; while Experience uses double-line.
% Some formatting codes are kept inline; consider \newcommand{cmd}{def}.
% Excludes hyperref and icons for readability; MVP version.
% Explore other templates for more options.
% Mix and match as desired. Be consistent with headers and sub-headers.

\section{Education}
%=================%
\subsection{University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson $|$ {\normalfont\itshape Mathematics (B.s.) and Data Science (B.s.)} \hfill Graduating May 2027}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cumulative GPA: 3.45
\end{itemize}
\section{Experience}
%=================%
\subsection{Exolambda, Richardson}
\subsubsection{Software Engineering Intern \hfill  May 2025 - Aug 2025}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supported the bring-up and validation of custom embedded avionics platforms, including board-level diagnostics, firmware initialization, and integration of sensing and compute modules.
    \item Implemented data acquisition and preprocessing pipelines for onboard IMU, GPS, and environmental sensors, enabling downstream statistical analysis and control-loop tuning.
    \item Developed and profiled real-time control and signal-processing routines, emphasizing numerical stability, latency bounds, and deterministic behavior under flight-critical constraints.
    \item Contributed to the design of internal monitoring and telemetry tooling used to inspect system performance, analyze failure modes, and quantify reliability metrics across development iterations.
    \item Built scalable build, test, and deployment workflows that automated integration of embedded software, simulation outputs, and hardware-in-the-loop testing artifacts.
    \item Collaborated with cross-disciplinary engineers to prototype algorithms linking sensor fusion, state estimation, and fault detection, with a focus on quantitative validation using collected flight-test data.
\end{itemize}
\section{Research}
%===============================%
\subsection{Ganglia Guardian | Dr. Gu}
\subsubsection{Statistics and Bioinformatics Research \hfill August 2025 - Current}
\noindent
Worked with Dr. Gu and graduate students to optimize clustering algorithms created
to analyze behaviors of mice by way of IMU measurements in order to probe for early
somatic signs of degenerative diseases. Project revolves around unsupervized affinety
propogation, gpu programming, and documentation infrastructure.
\subsection{Undergraduate Research Scholar Award | Prof. Bereg}
\subsubsection{Mathematics and Computer Science \hfill Fall 2024}
\noindent
Worked with Professor Bereg to analyze transversals over latin squares. The research
aimed to numerically verify and expand on the results of Wanless’s ”Transversals in Latin Squares” (2009), my work was mostly in creating effective and effecient algorithms on large matrices in C++.
\subsection{\href{https://github.com/ACM-TradeX/TradeX}{ACM Research Trade X} | Prof. Smiley}
\subsubsection{Statistics \hfill Spring 2024}
\noindent
Semester long research project with Professor Smiley, applying the \href{https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/panda}{PANDA} algorithm by
Professor Glass to financial markets to find assets which are most correlated in move-
ment, for use in a pairwise trading algorithm.
\section{Clubs and Organizations}
