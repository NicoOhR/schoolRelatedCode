    \begin{itemize}
      \item Name two variables in which you are interested in their relationship.\\
      \parindent An interesting relationship to investigate would be the relation between a drug dosage and the effect on the patient.
      
      \item Do you think a linear regression model is appropriate? Why?  \\ 
      \parindent With a large enough sample population this would be an appropriate problem for a discrete regression, however there are two possible hitches for this analysis. The first is that there is some heterodeskastity, with higher variances at higher dosages caused by more extreme bodily reactions. The second would be possible measurement error in the instrumentation of how we test effectiveness.
