  \opening{Dear Hiring Manager:}

  \noindent I am writing to apply for the Flight Software (C++)
  Internship for Summer 2026 at Varda. I came across the job listing
  on LinkedIn, and recalled a conversation I had with Will Ferenc
  where he recommended Varda. I am pursuing double degree Data Science
  and Mathematics at the university of Texas at Dallas, and on a
  technical level I specialize in Embedded firmware development.
  While the connection between mathematics and firmware seems tenuous
  at first, my interest in either stems from the same basic interest;
  I love working from first principles. To that end, I am interested
  in roles that involve writing and validating real-time software
  that operates close to the hardware and which has visceral,
  physical impact on the end product. Varda's emphasis on autonomous
  spacecraft systems and reliable flight software aligns with both my
  experience and long term goals.

  \noindent I have substantial experience developing software for
  embedded targets, both in a professional and amateur environment,
  as well as in a team oriented and independent project contexts. My
  work frequently involved C and C++ development, reading and
  applying datasheets and protocol specs, and debugging failures that
  span the hardware/software boundary. I am most at home working in
  Linux environments. In addition to coursework in numerical
  analysis, computer architecture and data structures, I continuously
  pursue hands-on projects outside of the classroom to sharpen my
  abilities in these domains. I am particularly drawn to flight
  software because of the demands made on software: interfaces must
  be explicit, failure modes well understood, and even in
  extraordinary circumstances, the software must continue to function
  correctly, which pushes me to engineer better solutions. Also, I really
  enjoyed working with people in
  the necessarily cross-disciplinary aerospace industry during my
  internship at Exolambda.

  \noindent Varda's mission is compelling because it treats space
  flight as something that can be made practical, more of an
  engineering problem to be solved and less hypothetical platitudes.
  The opportunity to contribute to software that directly enables
  guidance, navigation, control, power, and communications on a real
  vehicle is exactly the kind of responsibility I am seeking in an
  internship. Please let me know if there is anything else I can
  provide you with during this process.

  \closing{Sincerely yours,}
